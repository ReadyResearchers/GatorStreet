# Get rich quick, using AI

## Intro

How do you get rich? Some people gamble, some people just work hard. But what if I tell you that you can make money by getting into stocks. Would you have believe me? For my project, I decided to explore the combination of AI technology with the stock market. My goal is to create a tool that can predict the next big thing before it happen. I can achieve that by studying old data and current data of past stocks prices to predict the next market. 

## Tech Detail 


For this demo, I will be using `yfinance` to gather data and I will be using `pyplot` to graph my data in a form of a line graph and produce a graph. Since both `yfinance` and `pyplt` are well known libaries for graphing and gathing data from stocks websites. My goal for this demo is to produce something. For instance if I look at microsoft stocks I want to be able to see past and present data. For instance, I need to be able to answer some basic questions regarding my code and the stock. 

### Tools / libraries 
 - pandas 
 - streamlit 
 - numpy 
 - yfinance
 - pyplot

## Future Work 

 - Introduce machine learning and AI into the project
 - Find a way for the code to grab data by it self, and give me a list of potencial candidates
 - increase accuracy of the program
 - make it easier to use
 - produce a live graph of current data
